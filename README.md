Storj is building a decentralized cloud storage network.
[Check out our white paper for more info!](https://storj.io/white-paper)

----

Storj is an S3-compatible platform and suite of decentralized applications that
allows you to store data in a secure and decentralized manner. Your files are
encrypted, broken into little pieces and stored in a global decentralized
network of computers. Luckily, we also support allowing you (and only you) to
retrieve those files!

# Build

Download and install the latest release of Go (at least Go 1.13) at [golang.org](https://golang.org/).

When ready, building the shared library is as easy as executing:

```
make build
```

The output is in the `.build` folder.
